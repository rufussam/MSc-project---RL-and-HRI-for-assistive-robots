            <source>We are now moving to the main part of the activity. I will explain what are we going to do. As you would have already noticed, you can see 5 objects, that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 placed in the table. I will ask you to guess one object. But sure, do not say it to me what you have guessed.</source>

            <source>Based on your response, I will try to eliminate my wrong guesses and try to find the correct one which you have thought. The important thing is, the more the guesses I do wrongly, better I get. Afterall, I am a humanoid robot and I learn like humans do. You can see the confidence level in my tablet trying to get better at every question. Once I find the guessed object, I will it back to the place where you are?</source>

            <source>You can answer my question through two modes of interaction. You can choose either one. The first one is through my tablet. It is as simple as it sounds. Just click the appropriate option on my tablet to select your response. Do click only once, as I have been programmed in that way. The second option is called ‘Naomarks’. You should show me an appropriate response with the signboard you have been given. Please give me 10 seconds for every response you show through the signboard.</source>
